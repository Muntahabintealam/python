Program starts by asking the user the number of days they want to analyze:

Enter the number of days:
When the user has entered the number of days, the program starts inquiring the number of kilometers the user jogged in each day:

Enter day X running length:
Where X is a placeholder for the number of the day, starting from 1.

If the user enters zero kilometers in three consecutive days, the program should print:

You had too many consecutive lazy days!
Then the program should quit without any further output.

When the user has entered jogging data for X days, the program displays its judgement in one of the following formats.

If the average of the kilometers jogged per day is less than 3.00 kilometers, the program should print:

Your running mean of Y.YY km was too low!
On the other hand, if the average is 3.00 kilometers or more, the printout should be:

You were persistent runner! With a mean of Y.YY km.
In both cases above Y.YY is the placeholder for the average of the jogging distances expressed with two decimals.

Program ends after the printout.
